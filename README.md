## Q1
**Objection:**

- **Consciousness Argument :** While Turing avoids claiming machines will achieve consciousness, the question of whether truly intelligent behavior can exist without it remains.

**Turing's refutations:**

- **Learning and adaptation:** The Turing Paper suggests that machines can learn and improve, potentially overcoming limitations in their initial programming.

**New objections:**

- **Super AI Argument:** Although not entirely true, some people worry about AI surpassing human intelligence and posing an existential threat.

**Turing's prediction:**

Turing's prediction of a 30% chance of a machine passing the Turing Test by 2000 was overly optimistic. Significant progress in AI has been made, but achieving human-level conversational ability and general intelligence remains difficult.
