## Q1
**Objection:**

- **Consciousness Argument :** While Turing avoids claiming machines will achieve consciousness, the question of whether truly intelligent behavior can exist without it remains.

**Turing's refutations:**

- **Learning and adaptation:** The Turing Paper suggests that machines can learn and improve, potentially overcoming limitations in their initial programming.

**New objections:**

- **Super AI Argument:** Although not entirely true, some people worry about AI surpassing human intelligence and posing an existential threat.

**Turing's prediction:**

Turing's prediction of a 30% chance of a machine passing the Turing Test by 2000 was overly optimistic. Significant progress in AI has been made, but achieving human-level conversational ability and general intelligence remains difficult.

## Q2

**1. Driving in the centre of Karachi:**

- **Possible:** No
- **Explanation:** Self-driving cars struggle with complex, unpredictable environments like Karachi si currently not possible.

**2. Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems:**

- **Possible:** Yes, but not fully
- **Explanation:** AI can discover and prove some theorems, but the AI most of the time relies on human intervention for some guidance.

**3. Writing an intentionally funny story:**

- **Possible:** Yes
- **Explanation:** AI can now generate creative and humorous text with the help of new language learning models(LLM)

**4. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law:**

- **Possible:** No
- **Explanation:** AI can assist lawyers with research and analysis. However, it cant pass judgment.

**5. Translating spoken English into spoken Urdu in real time:**

- **Possible:** Yes, but not fully
- **Explanation:** AI translation in real time has gotten very accurate for more popular languages like Chinese, but not with Urdu.
  
## Q3

**Domain:** Minecraft 


- **Partial Accessibility:** While the agent can perceive the game world through observations (blocks, items, entities), some information might not be immediately accessible (e.g., player inventory, hostile or peaceful mobs).
- **Not Deterministic Gameplay:** Given the same starting state and actions, the environment will always change depending on the current action. (e.g crafting tools, making a base for shelter)
- **Episodic Nature:** Each game session can be considered a separate episode with a defined goal (e.g., survive for X nights, defeat the Ender Dragon).
- **Partially Static World:** The overall game world layout remains static (same number of biomes), but the agent's local environment changes dynamically as it interacts (e.g., breaking blocks, placing items).
- **Continuous State and Action:** The agent's state space (e.g., position, health, inventory) and action space (movement, interaction) are both continuous.

**Best Architecture:**
**Reinforcement Learning**, as the agent can learn from its environment through trial and error. Reinforcement learning models are also very suited for adapting.

## Q4

**1. Exploring the Subsurface of Arabian Sea:**

- **Performance:** Gather data about the environment, navigate safely, avoid obstacles and dangers.
- **Environment:** Deep underwater
- **Actuators:** Movement controls (thrusters, direction), manipulator arms (sample collection)
- **Sensors:** Sonar (mapping environment), cameras (limited visibility imaging).


**2. Playing a Tennis Match:**

- **Performance:** Return opponent's serves, hit winning shots, follow game rules.
- **Environment:** Tennis court.
- **Actuators:** Swinging racket, footwork, strategic movements.
- **Sensors:** Vision (ball trajectory, opponent's position, etc.)

**3. Practicing Tennis Against a Wall:**

- **Performance:** Improve tennis skills, practice specific shots.
- **Environment:** Tennis court
- **Actuators:** Swinging racket, footwork, strategic movements.
- **Sensors:** Vision (ball trajectory, impact with wall).

**4. Performing a High Jump:**

- **Performance:** Jump over a bar at the highest possible height.
- **Environment:** Athletic track.
- **Actuators:** Running, jumping, coordinated muscle movements.
- **Sensors:** Vision.


**5. Bidding on an Item at an Auction:**

- **Performance:** Win the desired item at the lowest possible price.
- **Environment:** Auction platform, auctioneer, time constraints.
- **Actuators:** Placing bids, monitoring other bids, making strategic decisions.
- **Sensors:** Visual, auditory.
  
## Q5

**1. False:**

While an agent with partial information might not be able to achieve **perfect** rationality, it can still make **rational** decisions based on the information it has access to.

**2. True:**

Imagine a complex traffic intersection with unpredictable elements such as jaywalkers or sudden vehicle breakdowns. A pure reflex agent programmed to respond only to an immediate sensor reading (such as a red light) can make dangerous decisions in these dynamic situations, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated reasoning skills.

**3. False:**

Reason is subjective and depends on the task, environment and evaluation criteria. An agent considered rational in one context may not be so in another context.

**4. False:**

The Agent Program is a complete system that includes agent functionality, performance measurement and sensors/actuators. The Agent function itself receives as input only an observation of the environment.

**5. False:**

Not all agent functions are necessarily implementable. Complex functions requiring vast computational resources or violating physical laws might be impossible to realize with current technology.
